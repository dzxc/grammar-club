**Answer key 10**  
>  
1.(D)  
the trip是一段时间，也是一条路程，可用on或along。  
2.(B)  
owing to类似because of，表示因果关系。A和D都要加上to才能当短语
用，C的viewing不能当介系词用，只有 considering可以这样使用。  
3.(C)  
用at the sound表示“听到声音那一刻，马上就冲出来”。  
4.(B)  
a right to表示“对于某事的权利”，是常用短语。  
5.(C)  
表示长宽（面积）的“ × ”读为by。  
6.(B)  
through表示头尾包括在内，故一周中只有Sunday不开。  
7.(B)  
这是双重所有格，以a home of his own的方式来同时表示a home和his own
home。  
8.(D)  
“以……之单价出售”，应用at。  
9.(A)  
每周计算应用by the week。  
10.(C)  
空格前的to是close to的一部分，应当介系词看待，因而要接动名词作宾
语。  
11.(A)  
with prices so high是以介系词短语方式来减化副词从句be cause prices
are so high。答案 C 的后面应改为because of high prices方可。答案B
和D都是从属连接词，可是后面的从句缺了动词。  
12.(B）  
本句中the sun指阳光，是立体的范围，故用in。  
13.(B)  
on a cup of coffee…表示“只靠一杯咖啡……（来维持体力)”。  
14.(B)  
becoming to one表示“很适合某人（穿戴)”。  
15.(A)  
因为下文说blurred (模糊)，故选out of focus (没对好焦距)。  
16.(B)  
下文说观众哄堂大笑，前面则是“场合严肃”，故要表示“相反”的关系（ A
或 B )。而A的although是从属连接词，不能连接名词短语the seriousness，
故用介系词的B。  
17.(D)  
“除了”可手提，还可提供高品质音响。这个“除了”是“除了这还有那”
的意思，应用besides。C的beside是“在…旁边”，A的aside是副词，B
的far from则是“决非……”。  
18.(A)  
except for表示“除了……以外”，表示“这个不算”。  
19.(D)  
regardless of 是“不顾，不管”。  
20.(C)  
on behalf of 是“代表”。
