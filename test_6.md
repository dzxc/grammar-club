**译文：**  

10前，几近150万头大象还在非洲存活。而这10年来，大象数目已减少了一半。尽管对偷猎大象的谴责日渐高涨，但为了获得贵重的象牙，这些大象仍一直遭到猎杀如今遇害的大象大都死于非法盗猎者之手。  

大象是草食动物，成年象一天可吃掉300磅的草。长途跋涉、到处寻找食物时，大象一天可移动数十英里的距离。若找不到最喜欢的草，大象会转而吃树。  

今日仅存、可供大象活动的草原已严重减少。大象迁移路线上有多处已开辟成农场。有些大象在农场觅食时被农人打死。  

在台湾的人，对遥远地方这种饱受威胁的动物能出什么力？首先，我们要了解大象受法律保护，在台湾亦然。象牙或大象身体任何部分的制品都禁止走私、买卖。有些以刻印维生的残障人士抗议这条法律侵害他们的生计，让他们不赚钱。当然象牙有许多替代材料，很主要的一种就是水牛角。大部分国家已不再进口象牙。希望买卖象牙的禁令能挽救现存的非洲象。野生动物保护组织，如世界自然基金会，面对这个问题也不是纯然束手无策。他们表示象牙生产国无法保护国内的大象，所以提出了一些市场导向的方法来解决这一问题。
